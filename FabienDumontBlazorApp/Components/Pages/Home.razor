<h1>Welcome to my web app !</h1>

<p>
    Hello and welcome to my web app, I am Fabien Dumont, a 26-year-old full-stack developer from Tulle, France.
    I've been into tech and coding since I was a teenager.
</p>

<p>
    In 2020, I got my master's degree in software development from the University of Poitiers in France.
    I'm good at using C#, WPF, and Blazor in the .NET world. I'm also familiar with Git, Jira, and Oracle Databases,
    which helps me take a well-rounded approach to software development.
</p>

<p>
    Besides coding, I enjoy playing the drums as a way of expressing myself. I also like reading history books
    because understanding the past helps us see the present and future more clearly.
</p>

<p>
    When I'm not working, you might find me at the gym lifting weights or watching movies and cheering for my
    favorite sports teams on TV.
</p>

<p>
    I created and deployed this web app myself using Blazor Server, Azure and Github Actions.
</p>

@code {
    private string defaultConnection = "";

    protected override void OnInitialized() {
        defaultConnection = Config.GetConnectionString("Default") ?? "unknown";
    }

}
